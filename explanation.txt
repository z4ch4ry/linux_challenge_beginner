   I used for the script the commande ls -l, i used
   it because it was the first command that i learned and it print more details about the file.
   The second way is to do with wc-c that print the size and the name of the file.

3. I used the sort-d, like a dictionnary. I used it because all the characters are alphanumeric
   and also if i want to know if a string is in the file it will take less time, so in my opinion it is more usefull.
   The default option is like the dictionnary but can sort all the characters and put numbers after letters
